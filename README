this is a attempt at converting google graph API to work with Codeigniter.
for codeigniter please visit http://codeigniter.com.
for google graph code, visit http://code.google.com/apis/chart/

its not the cleanest thing in the world...but it gets the job done for what its coded for.
regular implementation of Google charts is a pain. i made it a little bit more dynamic, so that you can use charts with data from 
mysql database.
you will need to supply the column/row data (i suggest running queries to add the data)
and then the draw() will create the proper chart you want.
