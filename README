this is a attempt at converting google graph API to work with Codeigniter.
for codeigniter please visit http://codeigniter.com.
for google graph code, visit http://code.google.com/apis/chart/

its not the cleanest thing in the world, but it gets the job done.
place the visualgraph.php inside 'gchart/' directory. and place the Gchart.php inside the libraries folder in application/ directory

this is released under GNuGPLv3.
please send email for any question/comments or suggestions
